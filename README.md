# ðŸš€ DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker & GitHub

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline** built using **Jenkins, Docker, GitHub, and Linux**.  
The pipeline automatically builds and deploys a **containerized Python Flask web application** whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.  

To enable GitHub webhooks, **ngrok** was used for exposing the local Jenkins server to the internet.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
1. **Developer pushes code** to the GitHub repository.  
2. **GitHub Webhook (via ngrok)** triggers Jenkins.  
3. **Jenkins Pipeline** executes:  
   - Clones the repository  
   - Builds a new Docker image  
   - Runs placeholder tests  
   - Deploys the containerized app  
4. **Flask App** becomes available at `http://<server-ip>:5000` with updated changes.
